# The Pixel is expensive because it needs to be

If you are an Android Nerd, you remember the original Moto X. It was a phone beloved 
by all of us, and bought by none. It was philosophically awesome, but practically 
most people went with another phone. The idea of the phone was to focus on user 
experience rather than specs. To provide a smart helper through contextual awareness. 
To make peoples most personal device individual by offering a slew of colors and 
materials. To focus on optimized and up to date software instead of features that 
get quickly forgotten. The philosophy was to build a _smart_ phone.

The first version of this great idea sold badly. Motorola's ownership changed and 
the second iteration already lost some of the original spirit. Parts of the philosophy 
lived through the years and traces of it can still be found in the X Style and the 
new Z. But the original vision was never fully realized. The unstable ownership plays 
a big role in that part, but fundamentally the biggest issue was simple: the phones 
didn't make money.

People weren't buying the original Moto X for a great many of reasons that are all 
debatable. In my opinion, it's quite simple: the first iteration was able to show 
and explain the vision, but not deliver it fully. The whole device was a piece of 
outdated hardware. The processor simply wasn't top of the line anymore. Relevant 
or not, people are, and back then more than now, noticing that and they get nervous 
of buying a phone that isn't future proof. With other devices available in the same 
price bracket but with better specs, people simply got skeptical. A lot of buying 
decisions are made for irrational reasons by buyers who aren't well versed on the 
topic. You can't even blame them. I find myself standing in front of shelves filled 
with hair shampoo, with not metric to make a buying decision, too often to judge 
others for not knowing how to choose.

No matter what your vision for a phone is, you need money and time to realize it. 
You go ahead and build the first iteration that is good enough to show what you are 
trying to do. You sell that and use the money to make next years phone better. If 
you are truly trying to innovate, you can't operate on low margins. Low margins 
mean you have to cut corners. It means using cheaper storage and getting trounced 
by the iPhones fast read and write speeds. It means using off the shelf components. 
A lot of people are noticing the lack of alignment on Samsung phones. They interpret 
it as careless design. I can guarantee you, the designers are asking to get the 
permission to align every year. But to achieve that, you have to replace off-the-shelf 
components, like connectors, by ones made to spec. And that costs you. Apple can 
afford it, Samsung can't. Being the Korean behemoth it is, Samsung is able to compete 
with Apples money because they manufacture so much of their components themselves. 
But even despite that, they often sell their best chips to Cupertino before they 
built them in their own devices.

When you really want to bring to something new to phones, it will almost always involve new hardware. Like fingerprint readers. The original Moto X had a dimple on 
it's back, that was always meant to be a fingerprint reader, if not in the first then 
in later iterations. These plans evaporated when Apple bought the only supplier able 
to build fast fingerprint readers at the time. It took two years for another supplier 
to fill that void. Apple bought that supplier with money the earn on selling expensive 
iPhones an it allowed them to have a unique feature for more than a year.

A good example of what a lack of cash does to innovation in an industry are laptop 
touchpads. Apple invested money and now they have the best ones. 
They completely overengineered them and made them pressure sensitive. I have no idea
what benefits the Taptic Engines virtual click has over a real, actual click, but they 
have it. Even if a supplier had developed a superior touchpad like that, Windows 
OEMs wouldn't have used them. They would have been to expensive and the additional 
work of writing the drivers is nothing that any OEM does voluntarily.

Without cash, you will always be dependent on off the shelf hardware. So when Qualcomm 
get's caught with their pants down by a new 64-bit Apple processor, you are literally 
waiting for two full years for them to catch up again. You also can't get any special 
cores on the die, because Qualcomm sells to all OEMs and they sell the lowest common 
denominator. And if a strong crypto suit isn't in that, you can't offer full disk 
encryption without slowing the device down.

This is why the Pixel is expensive. It's a signal and it's an investment in the 
future. The current generation may not even be worth that money, compared to the 
competition. The hardware is top of the line, but still off the shelf. However, the 
price is a promise for the next generation. This obviously won't influence peoples 
buying decision _this_ year and probably it shouldn't. Buy the best phone for the 
best price _right now_. 

But I bet you that Google's strategy will ensure that next year, this picture will 
look very differently.

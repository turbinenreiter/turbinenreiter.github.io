# What’s next in smartphone design?

When the first iPhone came out, it defined the new design pattern that eventually all smartphone makers would follow. A smartphone now is a screen on a rectangular box. This basic recipe will stay with us for a long time, but let’s look at how the details evolved.

## Screens got bigger
The Galaxy line always came with bigger screens than the iPhone, and with the Note they took it to a new extreme — that didn't stay extreme for long. The original Note had a 5.3 inch screen — 4 years later, the S6 comes with 5.1 inches, and 5–5.5 inch is now the norm for Android flagships, with Phablets going up to 6 inches.

## Bezels got smaller
Bigger screens means bigger devices, the opposite of what we want for mobile phones we carry every day, so manufacturers started to trim the bezels. LG excelled at that with the LG G2, which is nothing more than a screen. They even had to move the buttons to the back, because there was no space for them on the side. Beautiful phones, which didn't manage to get rid of the unused space around the screen, got criticized, even if there are good reasons for that little extra bezel, like front-facing speakers or physical buttons.

## Trimming the fat
Another way to make big stuff feel small is to make it thinner. But this makes it harder to fit in batteries and cameras. Cameras use optics to capture light and direct it onto a sensor to make pictures. In order to make pictures with good quality, the optics have to take up some space — physics doesn't allow us to make camera modules smaller. So the protruding camera was born — an ugly pimple on the backs of otherwise beautiful devices. A pimple that poses little to none usability drawbacks, one that vanishes when using a case, but still one that just doesn’t look nice. For some it’s no big deal, for others it’s reason enough to write 600 words on the future of smartphone design.

There is a common theme here. We want big screens, long battery life, great cameras — but small devices. A contradiction that leads to compromise, but better technology and better design can reduce the compromise we have to make.

## The next step in fitting big features in small footprints
When Apple showed the new MacBook, they also showed us a possible future in smartphone design. A future that already was heralded by the LG G2 and the Moto X.

What the MacBook has, and what the LG G2 had, is a terraced, or stepped battery. That means the thickness of the battery isn't uniform, but rather can be varied to fit the shape of it’s enclosure. This way it can use the space optimally and bigger batteries fit into smaller devices. It allows for the device to be shaped differently than the rectangular box we got used to, and this new shape deputed with the original Moto X in 2013. Having a curved back means that device get’s to feel small, while still having a maximum thickness that can house a good camera without protruding. It nestles nicely in the hand, is sturdy and has room for a big battery.

Ironically, that’s also the two things the Moto X didn't have, and still doesn't. Good camera and good battery. What it does have is a great design that makes it possible to have both, without the compromises flat backs have to make.

All Motorola has to do is buy stepped batteries from LG and getting the camera right. Which is something we have heard before … .

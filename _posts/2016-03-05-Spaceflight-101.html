<h2 id="what-is-spaceflight">What is Spaceflight?</h2>
<p>Spaceflight means flying to outer space.</p>
<p>Outer space is the space between the objects existing in it. If you are not on a planet, moon or other type of celestial body, you are in space. The boundaries between those bodies and space is not clear. For example, the earths atmosphere definitely belongs to the earth, not to space. But the atmosphere doesn&#39;t suddenly stop, it just gets thinner. At 10 kilometers above ground, it&#39;s so thin, that you can&#39;t breath, but you can still fly an airplane. At 400 kilometers, there is so little air that you need a spacesuit, but there is still enough air that the ISS, which operates at that altitude, has aerodynamic drag.
For that reason, we created an imaginary boundary at 80 kilometers. If you go above that, you are in space. Except if you ask an European, because in Europe, the line is drawn at 100 kilometers. Others say that to become a real astronaut, you have to complete at least one full orbit around earth.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-orbit">What is an Orbit?</h2>
<p>An orbit is a circular, or elliptical, path of an object around another, bigger, object in space. The earth is on an orbit around the sun and the moon around the earth. If you want to go to space, you will always have to be in orbit around something else.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-get-there">How do I get there?</h3>
<p>To get to orbit, you need to reach a very high velocity. To do that, rockets are used, and how they work will be explained later.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/Spaceflight101/orbit.svg" alt="From sub-orbit to orbit"></p>
<p>This picture shows three flights. The first one, in the faintest red, shows a sub-orbital flight, that does not reach space (the black, dotted line marks the border). The rocket goes up and drops back to earth without going higher than 100 kilometers. The second flight is a sub-orbital spaceflight. The rocket drops back to earth, but it reached space for a short time. The darkest red shows a full orbit. This rocket reached space and is fast enough to stay there.</p>
<p>The energy needed to go up to a certain altitude is <script type="math/tex">E_{pot} = m \cdot g \cdot h</script> - where <script type="math/tex">g</script> is the gravity of earth and will be explained a bit more later, <script type="math/tex">m</script> is the mass of our spacecraft and <script type="math/tex">h</script> is the altitude we want to reach. The higher we want to go, the more energy is needed. In addition to that, a bit more energy is needed to overcome aerodynamic drag.</p>
<p>The difference in those flights is the velocity that is reached. The faster the rocket goes, the closer it comes to reaching orbit. It is far easier to reach the altitude than to reach the velocity needed to stay there.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-stay-there">How do I stay there?</h3>
<p>Gravitation is the force between to objects that have mass. On earths surface, we can calculate that force as <script type="math/tex">F = m \cdot  g</script>. The key to this equation is the range of validity that is given in the first part of the prior sentence - <em>on earths surface</em>.
When Gravitation is the force between two objects with mass, than both objects mass are relevant. Also, gravitational force is dependent on the distance of the objects. The same is true for magnetic forces. The closer you put to magnets together, the stronger the force between them gets.
In above equation, both the earths mass and the distance between the objects is considered in <script type="math/tex">g</script>. The equation for g is <script type="math/tex">g = \frac{G \cdot m_{Earth}}{r^2}</script> - where G is the gravitational constant. The earths mass <script type="math/tex">m_{Earth}</script> is known and the distance <script type="math/tex">r</script> is simply the earths radius. And, yes, that means that <script type="math/tex">g</script> is different depending on where on earth you are - on the top of a mountain it is less than on the bottom of a valley - but this difference is very small compared to the earths radius of about 6400 kilometers.
For a spacecraft, however, that difference is a lot bigger. The ISS is at about 400 kilometers, which means it&#39;s distance is 6800 instead of 6400 kilometers.</p>
<p>With <script type="math/tex">g</script> calculated for the specific orbit we want, it&#39;s now known how big the force is, that wants to pull the spacecraft back to earth. To stay in orbit, we need to counter that force with another force. The force used for that is the centrifugal force and the biggest problem with that force is that it doesn&#39;t really exist. It&#39;s a so called pseudo force and physics teachers all over the world will probably want to hit me for using it to explain things.</p>
<p>Imagine holding on to a carousel. As long as you hold on to it, there is a force holding you in your place. It&#39;s the centripetal force. It binds you to the carousel and it is directed inwards, to the axis the carousel rotates around. The centrifugal force, is the opposing force to it and it&#39;s directed outward, away from the axis of rotation. It only exists as long as the centripetal force exists. As soon as you let go, both forces vanish and that&#39;s the reason it&#39;s called a pseudo force. It isn&#39;t really there.
What really is there, is inertia. A body with a certain velocity keeps that velocity, until there are external forces working against it. Inertia is what keeps you going when you push on a skateboard. Friction is what slows you down. The lower the friction, the longer you keep going, which is why you buy those fancy bearings. In space, there is no friction, because there is no air and no concrete to rub against, so once you gain a certain velocity in space, you keep it.
But this inertia doesn&#39;t just make sure you keep your velocity, but also your direction. You feel this when you sit in a car and it goes through a curve. The car changes it&#39;s direction, by rubbing it&#39;s wheels against the concrete, and you are forced to come along. Your bodies inertia however, doesn&#39;t want to make the curve. And because the cars force that drags you along acts on your butt on the seat, and the inertia acts on your center of mass, which is higher on your body, you tip to the side.
And that is what in the end is the centrifugal force. The centripetal force forces you to go in a circle, but your inertia wants to go in a straight line. The difference is the centrifugal force.</p>
<p>Our spacecraft gains a very high velocity and thereby a lot of inertia. Then it is forced into a circular orbit by earths gravity. But the inertia is big enough to balance that gravity, resulting in our spacecraft staying in its orbit. The gravity doesn&#39;t make it fall down, it makes it go in circles, because the inertia is strong enough to counter gravity.</p>
<p>In equations, this balance looks like that:  </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F_{gravity} = F_{centrifugal}</script><p>Remember, the gravitational force is our centripetal force, with the centrifugal force opposing it. Now we drop in the equations to calculate those forces:  </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">m \cdot g = m \cdot a_{centrifugal}</script><p>The centrifugal acceleration depends on the velocity and radius. The smaller the radius <script type="math/tex">r</script> or the higher the velocity <script type="math/tex">v</script>, the bigger the acceleration. We also see that the mass can be taken out of the equation - which means for the orbit of a an object, it&#39;s mass doesn&#39;t matter:  </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">g = \frac{v^2}{r}</script><p>Now we insert the equation for g  </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{G \cdot m_{Earth}}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r}</script><p>and replace <script type="math/tex">G \cdot m_{Earth}</script> with <script type="math/tex">\mu</script>  </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\mu}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r}</script><p>which we can shorten to  </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}}</script><p>With this equation, we can calculate the velocity we need to stay in any orbit around the earth. We also see, that the further out we want to go, the less velocity we need to stay up, because the gravitational force gets weaker. The total energy needed is still higher, because in addition to the kinetic energy for the velocity, potential energy to gain altitude is needed, as described before.
The energy needed to reach that velocity is <script type="math/tex">E_{kin} = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{2}</script>. The total energy needed to reach and stay in orbit is the sum of the energy needed to reach the altitude, the velocity and to overcome drag.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-rockets-work">How do rockets work?</h2>
<p>Imagine a car. The car has wheels that are turned by a motor. Those wheels are on the ground. The friction between the wheels and ground mean that the wheels can&#39;t just brush over the ground, but rub against it. Because the car is lighter than the earth that the ground is fixed to, the car is pushed forward.
Imagine a boat. It has a propeller at the end, that rotates in the water. The propeller pushes away the water, it flows because it isn&#39;t fixed. Still, it&#39;s heavy, and pushing it away takes a lot of force and the boat pushes itself through the water with the exact force that it pushes water away from it.
Imagine standing on a skateboard in front of a wall. If you push the wall, you roll away from it. Replace the wall with a second skater - if you push against him, bot of you will roll in opposite directions. The wall is the ground, the water is the second skater. The lesson is, you can propel yourself by pushing against things, even when they are not fixed.</p>
<p>How does that relate to the rocket? In space, there is nothing to push against, neither walls nor water. There is only the rocket.
And that means that the rocket has to bring its own water. The rocket is filled with it and pushes the water out of the back as fast as it can. By pushing the water out, it pushes against the water and thus accelerate itself forwards. The rocket literally pushes against stuff it throws out at the back.</p>
<p>There is two important consequences of that.
First, it means that rockets can work in space. They don&#39;t need anything external to push against, because they have that on board.
Second, it means that rockets only work as long as they have stuff to throw out back.</p>
<p>On a rocket designed to reach orbit, about 90% of its total mass is made up by the stuff it throws out. For example, the Ariane 5, a European rocket capable of transporting 20 tons of payload in a low earth orbit, uses about 700 tons of fuel to get there.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-rocket-motors-work">How do rocket motors work?</h3>
<p>For our rocket to take off, we need a machine that pushes a lot of mass out of its back, in a very short time and at a very high velocity. The only rockets currently strong enough to go to space both use their fuel for two purposes. First, it stores the energy needed to push the mass out, and second, it <em>is</em> the mass that is pushed out. The energy is stored chemically in the fuel and gets released by burning it. Burning it turns the fuel into an extremely hot gas, which contained in a small chamber means creating very high pressure. If that chamber now has a hole in one side, that pressure is released through that hole, meaning a lot of gas flowing out of the hot end of the rocket. This gas is what the rocket pushes against.
The machine burning the fuel is the rocket motor. Based on the fuel used, there are two main types.</p>

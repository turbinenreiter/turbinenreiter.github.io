# Writing when no one is reading

I created this blog about six months ago because I was interested in how to build one. I messed around with static site generators, modified templates, wrote some CSS. In the end I, landed on this little design running on GitHub Pages, my very own little soap box. This site was never driven by a desire to find a readership. The content on here mainly comes from forum posts I wrote on The Verge. Sometimes, I feel like writing, but I'm not a writer. I neither want to nor am I able to write posts daily and I surely do not want to prance around on social media to look for readers. Just sometimes when I want to say things, I want to say them. A forum is the ideal place to do that. It's a small community where you get a small number of eyeballs and that's all I wanted. I don't need to go viral. I write for myself. Mostly. Still, being read is nice. Even when you mostly write for yourself, being read gives you motivation. If I am the only one ever to see this, I wouldn't need to write it down, I could just spell it out in my brain. Tell it to my cat, if I had one. That's the joy of the forum. A small number of eyeballs. You write for a little community that you are a part of yourself.

Except if your not. I deleted my user account on The Verge after I got banned for complaining about coverage. I wrote a comment pointing out that I would rather see culture content about culture rather than gossip. The comment was deleted. At that point I strangely stopped caring. I wrote the same comment again, appended by a line stating that they are going to have to ban me if what I wrote wasn't OK to write. They did as I asked. After that, I wrote a mail to tech support, asking for the deletion of my account. You can't do that yourself on The Verge.

I'm not bitter about it. I still go there to read the articles. I'm just no longer a member of the community. Being a member of a community, being a fan of a site, it's a relationship. But ultimately, it's an asymmetrical one. It's a relationship where the partner isn't nearly as invested in you as you are in them. It's a relationship where one partner has the power to take the others voice. That's not really a big problem when you are talking about a forum, but it's a huge one when you are talking about a relationship. The interesting part here is that we _are_ talking about a forum, still I come up with this relationship talk. Why? Because I took that forum way to seriously.

I'm not sad that this part of my life is now gone, except I am still writing this. It's not the first community I left, although the first I got banned from. In a way, it's freeing. No need to invest in that weird relationship anymore. But today, I felt like writing again. I wanted to say things. That's when I realized what I lost. I lost the eyeballs. I lost my tiny readership.

I still got my little soap box, tough. I still have my text editor and my markdown processor and my domain. So I'm getting on the pedestal today and shout into the void of the internet, hoping that I can find one or two eyeballs again.

Please don't leave comments.
